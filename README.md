### Known Bugs 🤫
1. When watching a video, the frame must be hovered over in order to show the info regarding the video length and time passed. The script artifically hovers over the frame, but if it detects a user cursor, the script will crash because the info then becomes hidden. I am currently working on reading the values when the video is not hovered over, but for now, please resort to the temporary fix
```cmd
FIX: Keep your mouse away from the browser
```
2. When logging in to MyPlan, sometimes the request takes too long & the script times out.
```cmd
FIX: Run the script again
```
