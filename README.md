# Edgenuity Automated 😈
> 🏫 A browser script to automatically move to the next video/question when the video is complete or when the question is answered on an Edgenuity assignment!

> 🖊️ This helps students stay focused & productive throughout an activity & minimizes the time waste navigating between videos and questions

> NOTE: This script is not meant to be used to actually automate the process of completing an activity. It is meant to be used as a tool to boost productity and attentiveness.

## Known Bugs 🤫
1. When logging in to MyPlan, sometimes the request takes too long & the script times out.
```cmd
FIX: Try cicking the Login button in the browser (This isn't reliable because timeouts can still occur due to human error)
FIX: Run the script again (Usually works another time around)
```
